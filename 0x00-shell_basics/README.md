Shell basics involve interacting with a command-line interface, typically using a shell program like Bash. Here's a brief explanation:

Shell: A shell is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular shell used on Unix-based systems.

Command Prompt: When you open a terminal or command prompt, you're presented with a prompt where you can type commands. The shell reads these commands and executes them.

Commands: Commands are instructions given to the shell to perform specific tasks. They can be simple, like listing files (ls), or more complex, involving pipes, redirects, and other features.

Scripts: Shell scripts are files containing a sequence of shell commands. They allow you to automate tasks by executing a series of commands in a specific order. The #!/bin/bash at the beginning of a script is called a shebang or hashbang. It indicates the path to the shell interpreter (in this case, Bash) that should be used to execute the script.

0. To write a script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory, the first line of the script should include the "#!/bin/bash", followed  by the command which is : "pwd". Leave a new line after this script.

1. To display the contents list of your current directory: ls, but the first line should be the "#!/bin/bash"; like this:

"#!/bin/bash"
"ls"

2. A script that changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory:

"#!/bin/bash"
 "cd ~"

3. A script that print contents in current directory in a long format : 

"#!/bin/bash"
"ls -l"

4. A script that prints contents in current directory including hidden files and in long format : 

"#!/bin/bash"
"ls -la"

5. A script that displays the contents of the current directory in; long format, with user and group IDs displayed numerically, and hidden files starting with (.)

"#!/bin/bash
ls -la --numeric-uid-gid

6. A script that creates a directory named (my_first_directory) in the /tmp/ directory:

"#!/bin/bash"
"mkdir /tmp/my_first_directory"

7. A script that moves the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory
"#!/bin/bash"
"mv /tmp/betty /tmp/my_first_directory/

8. A script that deletes the file "betty" in the /tmp/my_first_directory"

"#!/bin/bash"
"rm /tmp/my_first_directory/betty"

9. A script that deletes the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory
"#!/bin/bash"
rm -r /tmp/my_first_directory

10. A script that changes the working directory to the previous one: 
"#!/bin/bash"
"cd -"

11. A scrript thatthat lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format:

"#!/bin/bash"
"ls -la . .. /boot"

12. A script that prints the type of the file named iamafile in the /tmp directory
"#!/bin/bash"
"file /tmp/iamafile"

13. A script that creates a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__ in the current working directory

"#!/bin/bash"
"ln -s /bin/ls --ls--

16. A script that deletes all files that end with character (~) in the current working directory
"#!/bin/bash"
"rm *~"
