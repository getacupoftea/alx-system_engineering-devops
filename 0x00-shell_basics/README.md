Shell basics involve interacting with a command-line interface, typically using a shell program like Bash. Here's a brief explanation:

Shell: A shell is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular shell used on Unix-based systems.

Command Prompt: When you open a terminal or command prompt, you're presented with a prompt where you can type commands. The shell reads these commands and executes them.

Commands: Commands are instructions given to the shell to perform specific tasks. They can be simple, like listing files (ls), or more complex, involving pipes, redirects, and other features.

Scripts: Shell scripts are files containing a sequence of shell commands. They allow you to automate tasks by executing a series of commands in a specific order. The #!/bin/bash at the beginning of a script is called a shebang or hashbang. It indicates the path to the shell interpreter (in this case, Bash) that should be used to execute the script.

0. To write a script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory, the first line of the script should include the "#!/bin/bash", followed  by the command which is : "pwd". Leave a new line after this script.

1. To display the contents list of your current directory: ls, bur the first line should be the "#!/bin/bash"

2. A script that changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory : "cd ~"
